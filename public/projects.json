But he also laid the foundations of what is today Morphogenesis, without which this field would probably not exist.From this, I decided to create a pair of glasses in homage to Alan Turing, using morphogenesis principles (strange attractors, reaction-diffusion). I found it interesting to develop an object that pays homage to him by highlighting an important current practice that doesn't exist thanks to him and isn't directly linked to his name, unlike digital technology.Process: Strange attractor programming(2d, 3D) > 3D interpretation > Shape drawing > Shape assembly > Modeling > Application of reaction-diffusion as texture."
